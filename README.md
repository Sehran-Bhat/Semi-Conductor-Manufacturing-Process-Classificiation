# Semi-Conductor-Manufacturing-Process-Classificiation

# ðŸ“Š Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Classification

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning classifier** to predict the **Pass/Fail yield** in a semiconductor manufacturing process. Modern semiconductor production involves monitoring hundreds of sensor signals, many of which may be irrelevant or noisy. The goal of this project is to identify the most significant features impacting yield quality and develop models that can accurately classify production outcomes.
